This is a solution for classic dining philosophers problem

## Problem Statement

Long time ago, five philosophers were living in a same house.
Each philosopher had their own room where they engage in their
professional activity of thinking. In the house there was also
a common dining room having a circular table which was surrounded
by five chairs. Each chair was labelled with a name of philosopher
who used to sit in it. They all sat anticlockwise around the table.
To the left of each philosopher a golden fork was laid and in the
center of the table there stood a large bowl of spaghetti which was
constantly replenished by the house servents. The philosophers were
expected to spend most of their time thinking however if anyone felt
hungry they would go the dining room sit down on their own chairs and
plunged into the spaghetti. But such as the nature of the shaghetti ,
that a second fork was required to carry it to the mouth. 
The philosopher therefore also had to pick up thefork on his right.
When the philosoher was finished he would put down both of his forks,
get up from his chair and continue thinking. Obviously, a fork could 
be used by only one philosopher at a time. If other philosophers want
it they had to wait until the fork is available again.
